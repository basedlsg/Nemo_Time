## Color Palette Generation Methodology

### Step 1: Select Base Color
- Started with HTML standard Dark Olive Green (#556B2F)
- Selected middle shade: #8B9456 as olive-500 (primary brand)
- Reasoning: Professional, modern, not too dark or bright

### Step 2: Generate Light Shades (50-400)
- Increased lightness progressively
- Maintained hue consistency (65-80° range)
- Reduced saturation for lighter shades
- Ensured subtle background use (50-100)
- Created usable accents (300-400)

### Step 3: Generate Dark Shades (600-950)
- Decreased lightness progressively
- Slightly increased saturation for depth
- Adjusted hue toward true green (82° for 700)
- Ensured text contrast on white backgrounds
- Created near-black for maximum contrast (950)

### Step 4: Create Neutral Scale
- Warm gray tones with olive undertones
- Consistent hue (60°) throughout
- Low saturation (5-14%) for neutrality
- 50-900 scale matching industry standards
- Prioritized text legibility on white

### Step 5: Design Semantic Colors
- Success: Greener olive variant (#5A7F3E)
- Warning: Yellower olive variant (#9B8B3E)
- Error: Reddish-brown olive variant (#8B4A3E)
- Info: Blue-gray for contrast (#5A6B7F)
- All tested for 4.5:1+ contrast on white

### Step 6: Accessibility Testing
- Ran all combinations through WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Verified WCAG AA compliance
- Documented exact contrast ratios
- Created usage guidelines based on results

      "Deployment complexity significantly reduced (67% fewer steps)",
      "Performance improvements in throughput and resource efficiency",
      "Enhanced document discovery with Perplexity integration",

    "decision_rationale": "The evaluation demonstrates clear advantages of RAG-Anything across multiple dimensions. The most compelling case is the dramatic reduction in deployment complexity (67% fewer steps) combined with improved performance characteristics and enhanced document discovery capabilities. The current system's deployment challenges and operational overhead create significant development friction, while RAG-Anything offers a path to simplified, more reliable operations."

      "Set up RAG-Anything development environment and prototype",
      "Implement Perplexity integration and government source filtering",
      "Create comprehensive test suite for validation",
      "Develop deployment automation and monitoring",
      "Plan data migration and system cutover procedures",
      "Train team on new system architecture and operations"
    ],
    "risk_mitigation_strategies": [
      "Maintain current system as fallback during transition",
      "Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting",
      "Create detailed rollback procedures and automation",
      "Conduct extensive testing in staging environment",
      "Plan gradual traffic migration with validation gates",
      "Establish clear success/failure criteria for each phase"
